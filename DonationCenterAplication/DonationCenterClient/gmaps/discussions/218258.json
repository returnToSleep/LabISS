I then want them to be able to close down the app, and reload it, opening up the existing overlays. Fairly easy to do with serialization I believe but it seems the classes I'd expect to do this sort of thing (e.g. GMapOverlay) aren't currently marked as serializable? Is there a reason for this?</p>",
