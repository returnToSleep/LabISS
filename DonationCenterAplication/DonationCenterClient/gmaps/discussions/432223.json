    "Html": "When I load the xml file for a cached map, it has the provider.  I use:\r<br />\n<br />\nGMapProvider provider = GMapProvider.TryGetProvider(xmlParams.ProviderGUID);\r<br />\n<br />\nGMapProvider base class does not have TryCorrectVersion.\r<br />\n<br />\nSo in order to set that public member value, I have to check the underlying type of GMapProvider, then set the value.  THEN I can assign it to map.MapProvider.\r<br />\n<br />\nIdeally, TryCorrectVersion would be a static member in GMapProvider.  But since I don't see that it is used anywhere but in Bing and Google, I don't think that's better.  Having it only in Bing and Google means that you have to IF (or Switch) the provider.  Having it static means it's set and done once.\r<br />\n<br />\nYes, you are right, I can do what you said.  However I believe this method is cleaner.<br />\n\r<br />\nAnyway, thanks for your help.<br />\n",
