    "Html": "<p>Hi All,</p>\n<p>I know it's a long shot but before i go searching the internet i need to know :- is there a way to find out an angle between 2 markers as i have knockup up a gps proggy on my phone and plotted it inside a windows forms proggy. I would like to have arrows pointing which way i was travelling so if i went south the arrow would point at the 6 oclock position, straight forward but what if i was travelling at the 1,2,3,4 etc oclock positions? If i had the angles then i could rotate an arrow image before placing it as a marker i guess.</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>",

I would guess the former but for the life of me i can't think what i'm doing wrong. I am putting points in a maproute called 'rts' and add the like </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">\r\n<p>gps.Routes.Add(rte) and i also add markers to gps where i can access the .bearing like gps.bearing but it's always empty.</p>\r\n<p>c# is not my strong point but i have checked the source code and i can't find where it's set?</p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">&nbsp;</span></p>",
