Well it would run perfectly despite the error, but then you can't work on design mode properly.\r\n You could omit the Zoom property and get no errors which would free your design mode, but you won't be able to see the map either way.</p>\r\n<p>I'm talking about the WPF version only, no idea how's it going on Windows Forms</p>\r\n",
