User sees a map of where they are via GPS (custom green circle GMapMarker). GPS history track shown in red (GMapRoute). Computer is talking to some radio equipment over USB/ethernet to get an instantaneous bearing\r\n towards a transmitter and see what the power spectrum looks like for that frequency (Bearing is shown in blue using GMapRoute which constantly updates). I wrote an algorithm to geo-locate the transmitter based on signal strength and bearing measurements and\r\n display the probability cloud over the map. That is the red and yellow cloud you are seeing in the center. Tells the user exactly where to drive to find the transmitter. I'm using a GMapImage for that. I'm made a bunch of different custom markers (in red)\r\n for displaying all licensed transmitters in the area. The user can also add marker their own markers (in green) which allows the user to add custom commentary or notes (and assign a custom letter to the marker). &nbsp;Records all the data and can be used for\r\n playing back the information as well.</p>\r\n<p>FAA uses it to find interference on their frequencies.</p>\r\n<p>I had a previous version written in C where I created the map myself using a graphics canvas and mapping tiles from OSM and Google. It was very time consuming figuring out how to draw the tiles and logic for navigating the map. It was very primitive although\r\n it allowed panning, zooming, and switching from satellite to street view. But using your control in C# has been a huge improvement. As you already know, it's packed with features and allows me to focus on the purpose of the software rather than focusing on\r\n getting the map to work. It's been a blessing. So thank you again.</p>\r\n",

In the example below, gmImage is my GMapImage and MainMap is my GMapControl.<br />\n<pre><code>// Assign the bitmap\ngmImage.Image = (your bitmap here); \n\n// Passing PointLatLng of top left (TL) corner of where to plot image\nvar tl = MainMap.FromLatLngToLocal(gmImageTL);\n \n// Passing PointLatLng of bottom right (BR) corner of where to plot image\nvar br = MainMap.FromLatLngToLocal(gmImageBR); \n\n// Setting the GMapImage position based on the top left corner\ngmImage.Position = gmImageTL; \n\n// Setting the GMapImage size based on the top left and bottom right corner\ngmImage.Size = new System.Drawing.Size(br.X - tl.X, br.Y - tl.Y); \n\n// Telling the map to redraw\nMainMap.Invalidate(); </code></pre>\n\nI'm assigning the Position and Size of the GMapImage each time because in my application it can be moved at anytime. If your position is fixed, you can skip those steps and simply resign the Image property of the GMapImage and then invalidate the GMapControl.<br />\n<br />\nAs for the red and yellow heatmap, I wrote a complex algorithm that generates that image every second based on the data I'm receiving from my instruments. It's a 1000x1000 pixel bitmap. I set the alpha characteristics to acheive the transparency. I'm not going to publish that algorithm. But as you can see from my code sample, it doesn't take much to have the image be updated in real-time once you have your image.<br />\n",

    "Html": "As for transparency... You need to make sure that the image colors have an alpha characteristic set. You have a few options.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf you have a color you want to be completely transparent, this is easy.  For example, say your image has a white background and in all the white areas, you want the image to be totally transparent.<br />\n<pre><code>myBitmap.MakeTransparent(Color.White);</code></pre>\n\nYou can also add an alpha characteristic to areas of the image so that they are partially transparent. I do not know who you are creating your image, but here is an example. Say I want to color a pixel in my image to be Red, but I also want it to be semi-transparent.<br />\n<pre><code>int alpha = 200; // Any number between 0 and 255 to set the alpha byte\nmyBitmap.SetPixel(xCoord, yCoord, Color.FromArgb(alpha, 255, 0, 0));</code></pre>\n\nThe above code sets that pixel to red with an alpha characteristic of 200 out of 255, meaning about 21% transparent. you could do this for each pixel in the image.<br />\n",

The&nbsp;SuperContextMenu can be found here:&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/KB/menus/SuperContextMenu.aspx&nbsp;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.codeproject.com/KB/menus/SuperContextMenu.aspx&nbsp;</a><br />\n</blockquote>\nThank you mike_mankus.\r<br />\n<br />\nI simplified the &quot;on marker click&quot; part with a simple loop and a messagebox which fills my needs. \r<br />\n<br />\nNotice I started the loop at 1 to skip the top most tooltip.<br />\n<pre><code>if (mouseOveredMarkers.Count &gt; 1)\n{\n     for (int i = 1; i &lt; mouseOveredMarkers.Count; ++i)\n     {\n          GMapMarker tt = mouseOveredMarkers[i];\n          MessageBox.Show(tt.ToolTipText , &quot; Hidden Text&quot;);\n     }\n}</code></pre>\n\n",
