When i use a static map like on the demo, the&nbsp;5 miles radius changes according to the zoom level and does not stay at 5 miles? On the demo the polygons shrink when using the static map so this is what is happening to my 5 mile radius. If you need screen shots then i will put a link to some.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for a quick response.</p>",
