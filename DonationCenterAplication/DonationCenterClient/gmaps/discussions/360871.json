So I need the &quot;Get Static&quot; button functionality.</p>\r\n<p>Being <strong>bg </strong>a background worker, the intruction calls MainMap (a gMapControl) Projection member (PureProjection Class). Sadly, it doesn't work anymore. Was there a change?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>bg</strong>.RunWorkerAsync(new MapInfo(<strong>MainMap.Projection</strong>, area, (int)numericUpDown1.Value, MainMap.MapType));</p>\r\n<p>So does MapType, a member of the class MapInfo by the way but I suppose it's related to GMapProvider as well when Point needs to be changed to GPoint at some lines.</p>\r\n<p>I hope to simplify the map to image export, but without this PureProjection I can't even get started.</p>\r\n<p>I got the code from here:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://navigational.googlecode.com/svn/Legacy/Gmap.NET/Demo.WindowsForms/Forms/StaticImage.cs\">http://navigational.googlecode.com/svn/Legacy/Gmap.NET/Demo.WindowsForms/Forms/StaticImage.cs</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I'm desperate... really.
