I've been using it for a school project and it's way better than the web based solution I was using last semester.</p>\r\n<p>I am using it to make a campus map, but since I have hundreds of markers and edges in a small space, it starts to run slowly when moving the map/etc.</p>\r\n<p>Here is an example of how many markers I have on the screen at one time:</p>\r\n<p>http://people.clemson.edu/~hodges8/mgrid/authoringtool.jpg</p>\r\n<p>Right now each marker is a custom GMapMarker and so is each edge. Can you think of a more efficient way to do this with your control? It's the only way I could think of to do it.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Adam</p>",

Check&nbsp;<a href=\"http://codepad.org/mYpx2Mfo\">http://codepad.org/mYpx2Mfo</a>. // GMapMarker m; m.Shape = new CircleVisual(m);</p>\r\n<p>I use it to display ~500 objects and scrolling is quite normal.</p>\r\n<p>If you found even faster way, let me know!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
