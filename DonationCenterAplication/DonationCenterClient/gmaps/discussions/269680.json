There are 12 markers on the map in the positions of numbers on a clock, drawing a line between each marker i would end up with an outline of a clock. How would I get an outline of a shape if there are markers in the middle\r\n of the clock and i only want the outer markers?&nbsp;The zoomtomarker? command may be of help because that must know the outer markers to zoom in to.</p>\r\n<p>Ideas anyone?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n",
