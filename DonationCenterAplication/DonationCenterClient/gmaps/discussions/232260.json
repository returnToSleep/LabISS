It made my life quite a bit easier.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>However, it would be great if mouse zoom worked when the cursor is over a marker. If markers used the standard MouseClickEventArgs, it would be fairly simple to check if the sender was a Marker object and the click event was a mouse wheel event and call\r\n the event on the GMapControl. Just a thought anyway, does anybody have a way around this? I sometimes have to plot many markers in close proximity to each other, so when the map is zoomed out it is one big blob of markers and the mousewheel doesn't work for\r\n zoom.</p>\r\n",
