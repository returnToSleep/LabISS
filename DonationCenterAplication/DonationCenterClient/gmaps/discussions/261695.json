    "Html": "<p>Hello radioman,</p>\n<p>I have a case where I'm drawing multiple System.Windows.Shapes.Path's&nbsp; (interconnected to represent one huge path)&nbsp; on a Canvas that sits on top of the GMapControl. The path represents a given route drawn based on a list of PointLatLng points. Now, whenever  the user pans or zooms in/out, I need to re-position my path. I want to avoid redrawing the path myself; I need to use a transformation instead, because the rendering would be done on the graphics card level when using the Transformation (of course I need  to have a good graphics card). The reason why I'm not using GMapMarker::Route is because my route can be composed of a tremendous number of points and I don't really need to keep all these points in memory, because I'll lose performance. Instead of that, I  keep only the sub paths in a list in order to redraw whenever the user changes the view of the map (pan/zoom). Any idea of how to get the pan/zoom offset in order for me to apply a transformation on my paths.</p>\n<p>by the way, I'm using the WPF version.</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>",
