This appears to ensure there is only one instance of that. So if i read this right, the one instance serves all the GMapControl.</p>\r\n<p>The issue is if i wish to have different settings for GMapControl on the GMap.NET.Singleton, eg. AccessMode.</p>\r\n<p>Is this possible somehow?</p>\r\n<p>If not is it possible to have 2 separate applications, each with a separate GMap.NET.Singleton with different settings?</p>\r\n",
