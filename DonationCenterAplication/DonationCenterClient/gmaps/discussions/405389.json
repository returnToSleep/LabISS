I am getting my coordinates from a mobile phone (android smartphone) and setting markers on OSM map, but sometimes the coordinates I get are not spot on .Let's\r\n say that I am on street Foo but sometimes I get that I am in the park nearby.&nbsp; Is there a way to correct / approximate my position so that the marker will be on street Foo? I have thought of getting multiple times the&nbsp; coordinates and make an average\r\n before sending them but with little result.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance and keep up the good job!!!</p>\r\n<p>Update:</p>\r\n<p>I have thought of an algorithm that uses reverse geocoding and tries to find the nearest street by getting the adresses of points surrounding the given coordinate. What do you think? Also I don't seem to find a reverse geocoding function in gmap although\r\n I have read <a href=\"https://greatmaps.codeplex.com/discussions/276640\">this.</a></p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">Thank you again .</div>\r\n",
