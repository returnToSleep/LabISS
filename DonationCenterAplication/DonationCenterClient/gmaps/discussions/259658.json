I want to be able to draw a marker on the map that updates on GPS data updating the location of the marker on the map, at the same time I would like to (hopefully) draw a line showing the route that it took. In\r\n addition, I would like this marker to rotate depending on heading information such that if the vehicle is moving with a southeast heading, the arrow-like marker will be pointing to the bottom right of the map. Could someone help me as to how to accomplish\r\n that? I read some dicsussions about the map rotating, but I don't want the map to rotate, rather I want the marker to rotate and the map to remain static. Any help would be appreciated.</p>\r\n",
