    "Html": "<p>All these formul&aelig; are for calculations on the basis of a spherical earth (ignoring ellipsoidal effects) &ndash; which is accurate enough* for most purposes&hellip; [In fact, the earth is very slightly ellipsoidal; using a spherical model gives errors typically up to 0.3% &ndash; see notes for further details]</p>\r\n<p>This uses the &lsquo;haversine&rsquo; formula to calculate the great-circle distance between two points &ndash; that is, the shortest distance over the earth&rsquo;s surface &ndash; giving an &lsquo;as-the-crow-flies&rsquo; distance between the points (ignoring any hills, of course!).</p>\r\n<p>The haversine formula1 &lsquo;remains particularly well-conditioned for numerical computation even at small distances&rsquo; &ndash; unlike calculations based on the spherical law of cosines. The &lsquo;versed sine&rsquo; is 1-cos&theta;, and the &lsquo;half-versed-sine&rsquo; (1-cos&theta;)/2 = sin&sup2;(&theta;/2) as used above. It was published by R W Sinnott in Sky and Telescope, 1984, though known about for much longer by navigators. (For the curious, c is the angular distance in radians, and a is the square of half the chord length between the points). A (surprisingly marginal) performance improvement can be obtained, of course, by factoring out the terms which get squared.</p>",
