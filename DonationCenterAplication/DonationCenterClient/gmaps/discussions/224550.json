Keep up the good work!<br>However, I have some problems creating a first application with it.</p>\r\n<p>Can you please tell me what I am doing wrong?</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>creating a new C# WPF 4.0 app in VS 2010 on x64 CPU.</li>\r\n<li>adding references to GMap.NET.Core.dll, GMap.NET.WindowsPresentation.dll, System.Data.SQLite.DLL</li>\r\n<li>trying to add the control via Toolbox -&gt; Choose Element -&gt; WPF Components -&gt; point to GMap.NET.WindowsPresentation.dll:<br>Then it says (translated):<br>&quot;The assembly &quot;GMap.NET.WindowsPresentation, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b85b9027b614afef&quot; could not be loaded. Maybe this assembly was downloaded, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=179545&quot;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Opening the sample projects does not work too. After the conversion to VS 2010 there are two errors concerning the OutputPath (which is set to x86). Additionally there are two warnings, where it says that it can't find GMap.NET.WindowsPresentation and GMap.NET.Core.<br>Do you have any ideas what I am doing wrong?</p>\r\n<p>Thank you in advantage!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

It is very strange. I were not able to get the control to the toolbar because of that. Neither I could build the WPF demo apps myself.<br>What the hell am I doing wrong?? :(</p>",
