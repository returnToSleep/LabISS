Or perhaps the correct way to do it?</p>\r\n<p>I have tried playing around with OnMouseWheel in GMapControl.cs, specifically in this part :</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>            <span style=\"color:blue\">if</span>(e.Delta &gt; 0)\r\n            {\r\n               <span style=\"color:blue\">if</span>(!InvertedMouseWheelZooming)\r\n               {\r\n                  Zoom = ((<span style=\"color:blue\">int</span>)Zoom) &#43; 1;\r\n               }\r\n               <span style=\"color:blue\">else</span>\r\n               {\r\n                  Zoom = ((<span style=\"color:blue\">int</span>)(Zoom &#43; 0.99)) - 1;\r\n               }\r\n            }\r\n            <span style=\"color:blue\">else</span>\r\n            {\r\n               <span style=\"color:blue\">if</span>(InvertedMouseWheelZooming)\r\n               {\r\n                  Zoom = ((<span style=\"color:blue\">int</span>)Zoom) &#43; 1;\r\n               }\r\n               <span style=\"color:blue\">else</span>\r\n               {\r\n                  Zoom = ((<span style=\"color:blue\">int</span>)(Zoom &#43; 0.99)) - 1;\r\n               }\r\n            }\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n.. tried to change that &#43;1 to things like &#43;0.1, &#43;0.5, etc. but I get problems like after the first zoom in, it stops zooming in (for 0.1) or for 0.5, it will zoom in quite far first time and then not allow scroll to zoom in further. I must be doing something\r\n very wrong!\r\n<p></p>\r\n",
