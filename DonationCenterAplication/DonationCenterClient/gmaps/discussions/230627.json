Google appears to do it - if you look around on&nbsp;the satellite view they have areas of different resolution, and adjust their zoom scale when you move into an erea with more or less detail. I also see that they get http 404 errors (but hide them by&nbsp;displaying an upsized lower resolution tile)&nbsp;when you are at the edge between two area with different levels of detail. This is something that I would like to dig deeper into when I get some time -&nbsp;unless someone already has done that. Until then I have set max zoom of 21 for the google maps, and live with getting http 404 errors some of the time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
