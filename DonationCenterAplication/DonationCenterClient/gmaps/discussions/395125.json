I&acute;ve noticed that when&nbsp;my main form closes there&acute;s a thread - I think it&acute;s only a thread - that stays in memory&nbsp;- maybe 15-30 seconds -&nbsp;and grows and grows\r\n in memory until it closes.</p>\r\n<p>A detailed&nbsp;view shows some strange errors concerning SQLite. Here&acute;s -a part- of the log&nbsp;of the closing&nbsp; process.</p>\r\n<p>[...]<span style=\"font-size:xx-small\"></span></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>The thread 0x1610 has exited with code 0 (0x0).</p>\r\n<p>SQLite error (5): database is locked</p>\r\n<p>SQLite error (5): database is locked</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:xx-small\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>.... more and more errors....<span style=\"font-size:xx-small\"></span> </p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SQLite error (5): database is locked</p>\r\n<p>SQLite error (5): database is locked</p>\r\n<p>SQLite error (5): database is locked</p>\r\n<p>SQLite error (5): database is locked</p>\r\n<p>SQLite error (5): database is locked</p>\r\n<p>The thread 0x1930 has exited with code 0 (0x0).</p>\r\n<p>The thread '&lt;No Name&gt;' (0x1c0c) has exited with code 0 (0x0).</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:xx-small\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>I don&acute;t use SQLite, so it appears to be a GMap bug.
