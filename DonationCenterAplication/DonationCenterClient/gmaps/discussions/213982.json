The MapWindow group has donated the first contribution which is a fairly complete port of Proj4 to the System.Spatial.Projections namespace.</p>\r\n<p>You can find the project here: <a href=\"http://dotspatial.codeplex.com/\">http://dotspatial.codeplex.com</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Dan</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>",

Maybe there is a way to take some of your code and pull it out into a &quot;System.Spatial.Mapservices&quot; type name space that people *(like me) could easily reuse to get those data sources into our other projects...
