Is there a later version released?</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br />/Peter</p>\n<p>*UPDATE*<br />I downloaded the latest WPF-version and had a look at the GMapMarker class an noticed that the class doesn't have an IsVisible property either. If this is omitted in the WPF-version for a particular reason, is there a preferred work-around? I've tried an approach but ran into an \"interesting\" side-effect whereas a marker fails to show although \"it is there\" in the MapControl.Markers collection...</p>",
