On the first mouse click it creates a new GMapPolygon object and adds it to the map.&nbsp; On each MouseClick, add the mouse point to the polygon and redraw.&nbsp; On MouseDoubleClick, complete the polygon and reset.&nbsp; Dragging points can be done easily too, but I haven't done the dragging of the mid-point of lines, just dragging polygon points.</p>\r\n<p>If I can extract this from our systems I'll post some code, or perhaps do a fork if there's enough interest.</p>",
