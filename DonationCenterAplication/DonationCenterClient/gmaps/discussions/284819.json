Its really fantastic, and I've been making steady process but I'm stumped with this problem. :)</p>\r\n<p>I'm using it to develop a Windows Forms application, and I've got a GMapControl on my form and am viewing maps from different service providers etc. For some reason though, the control will only display up to four tiles at a time. When I drag the map around,\r\n as soon as I drag to the 'right' to pull more tiles from the left, the tiles on the right disappear as the new tiles appear from the left ! The same happens when I drag the map down, I can only ever view 2 x 2 tiles on the control at once !</p>\r\n<p>I know I haven'e given any details here, code samples etc, but I was hoping that there was some silly setting which I've overlooked and that someone can point me in the right direction immediately !? :) If not.. I'll gladly give more info...</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n<p>Charles</p>\r\n",

To anyone who reads this and was going to reply, no worries I've got it sorted ! :)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I've found another discussion participant who was having issues with a blank map... Radiomans advice was to put this initialisation of the GMapControl into the Constructor. I had mine in a button click event.</p>\r\n<p>Moved it into the Constructor and I've now got a full screen, beautiful map. :)</p>\r\n<p>Thanks again for an awesome, fantastic component. It's really helpful !!!!</p>",
