With that code i place about 150 markers on the map. All in the Netherlands.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But i have several issues with that code. (So time to change:-) ). The first proble is that it takes about 10 seconds before the map is shown. This is even before i fire the rest of the code. The next problem is that with every&nbsp;SetCurrentPositionByKeywords  the map shift to that position (of course). And <a id=\"_GPLITA_2\" style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" title=\"Powered by Text-Enhance\" href=\"#\">the last</a> problem is that when all the markers are in place, every click on the map let the app hang.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So , is there a better way to get the lat/lng from the address <a id=\"_GPLITA_0\" style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" title=\"Powered by Text-Enhance\" href=\"#\">info</a>, and after that show all the markers. And what can cause the problem with showing the map in the first place?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Hein</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Radioman,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As i wrote, there were several issues. The first &nbsp;problem was with just showing a map, with just one marker. With GoogleMap it toke more than 15 seconds.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>But that one is solved by using an other map provider.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>That leaves me with the issue that when looping through a list of addresses and show the corresponding markers with&nbsp;<span>SetCurrentPositionByKeywords with every new marker the screen is centered around the new marker. With 150 markers which needs a refresh every 5 minutes is that not an option. Although the function is like that, for me it is not a good solution. So my question is: Is there a way to get the lat/lng which belongs to a address in the background, and when the list is made, than show the markers.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Regards,</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Hein</span></p>",
