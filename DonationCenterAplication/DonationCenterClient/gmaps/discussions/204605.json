Add 'GMapMarkerTransparent.cs' and 'GMapMarkerTransparentGoogleGreen.cs' to the 'GMap.NET.WindowsForms.Markers' folder of the GMap.NET.WindowsForms project.</p>\r\n<p>2. Add a link to these two files to the 'GMap.NET.WindowsForms.Markers' folder of the GMap.NET.WindowsMobile project.</p>\r\n<p>3. Set the build action of 'bigMarkerGreen.png' and 'shadow50.png' to 'Embedded Resource' in both the WindowsForms and WindowsMobile project.&nbsp; <strong>Transparency won't work without this change.&nbsp; When using Properties.Resources.* (or any other .NET CF imaging objects) to access images, the .NET CF removes transparency information.</strong>&nbsp; The images need to be loaded directly from a manifest resource stream to preserve transparency which is why the build action needs to be changed to 'Embedded Resource'.</p>\r\n<p>4. To view a sample, replace MainForm.cs in either the Windows Forms or Windows Mobile project with the appropriate version from the ZIP file.</p>\r\n<p>As demonstrated by the GMapMarkerTransparentGoogleGreen class, it is easy to implement your own transparent markers based on the abstract GMapMarkerTransparent class.&nbsp; <strong>Just remember to load images directly from a resource stream or file stream to preserve transparency information.</strong></p>\r\n<p>This is implemented with code from both <a href=\"http://www.koushikdutta.com/2008/07/virtual-earth-and-google-maps-tiled-map.html\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/chrislorton/archive/2006/04/07/570649.aspx\">here.</a></p>",
