For this task I have integrated an custom MapType, where the maxZoom ist set to 25 and the URL to my local tile server, which\r\n is able to provide the max zoom level. I tested the zoom levels with openlayers and it works fine.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The test with GMap failed due to integer overflow ( see: http://greatmaps.codeplex.com/discussions/246078 ) on zoom level 23.</p>\r\n<p>I want to ask if there are plans to fix this?</p>\r\n",
