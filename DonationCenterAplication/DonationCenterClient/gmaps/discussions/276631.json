I.E.: if a draw a square in the first layer, it will be overlapped with a circle that i draw in the second layer. Its possible to &quot;change the order&quot; of a Layer? (or something like layer.BringTofront/layer.BringtoBack).\r\n I know that i can change the way of draw things (drawing the circle in the first layer and square in the second). But, when i have somehting like 6 layers or more (they are created programmatically), its very troublesome to control this. I need the first layer\r\n always stay at top of the rest.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
