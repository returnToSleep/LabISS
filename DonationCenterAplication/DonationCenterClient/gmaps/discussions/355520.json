However, I need to insert some custom &quot;maps&quot; (replacing a building with its floor plans).</p>\r\n<p>I've been given .jpg images and some .pdf's containing images (which I'll probably extract as .jpg anyways). I also know the lat/long of the building. The related folder is titled &quot;TileDBv5&quot;. I do not know if this corresponds to the GMap's version or some\r\n other versioning.</p>\r\n<p>How could I go about extracting certain prefetched/cached maps (so I can overlay the floor plans) and reinsert the image? I do not need to import &quot;new&quot; only &quot;edited&quot; images so all the database fields should remain the same. Is there a tool that would allow\r\n me to export cached images and update the images in a .gmdb?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance for any help anyone can provide!</p>\r\n",
