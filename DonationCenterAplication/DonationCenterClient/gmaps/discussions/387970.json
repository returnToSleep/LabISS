I suppose I can capture the event &quot;onmapdrag&quot; and clear all the markers and add them again, but since the markers are added with &quot;real&quot; coordinates (not screen coordinates)\r\n I suppose there could be some thing to update them automatically? (I mean, stick them to the coordinates they have)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Regards!&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

I was confused because I've found Gmap.UpdateMarkerLocalPosition and&nbsp;UpdateMarkerLocalPosition and, using those, the markers and polygons were displayed on the map. I realize I was missing to add the overlay when I was looking why onmouseover tooltips were not working.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks radioman and xandolph.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Regards!</p>",
