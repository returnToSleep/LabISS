Does it save the new vacuumed file automatically ?....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"color:#800080\">2- In my application ,\r\n</span></strong></span>I have 3 tabs in a tab-control . each tab has its own GMap control . During loading , I need to display the image at the smalles zoom level &quot;zoom=1&quot; , ie displays the whole world (only 4 tiles). Then , if user need to use maps, he will\r\n click to load the Cash file of a large file &quot;500 MB&quot;.<br>\r\nTo do this , I have made a file with 4 tiles &quot;at zoom level 1&quot;. I want to load this file into the 3 GMap control , Do I need to repeat &quot;map.Manager.ImportFromGMDB &quot; 3 times ? .<br>\r\nAlso , what is the best method to make the program loads faster knowing that <br>\r\n&nbsp; - I have 3 Gmap Control into one form<br>\r\n&nbsp; - My Cash Data is really huge , more than 500 MB.<br>\r\n&nbsp; - User does not need to use map each time running the application . Ie , He may need to use the map every 4th time.So , we do not need to load the whole cash, just the cash at zoom level =1 &quot;having only 4 tiles&quot;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks,</p>\r\n",

I have vacuumed the database and it became from 260 MB&nbsp; to 340 KB.....But , when I run the application \"in CacheOnly mode\", it took much time and I discovered that&nbsp; the size&nbsp; of the cache file increased again to 260 MB. Why ?? . Normally , a gmdb file with 256 MB is created if the cache location does not include any database file . but This is not the case .It contains a small size database file and it is enlarged automatically .. Is this normal ?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>",
