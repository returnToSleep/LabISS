I finally could download the sourcecode an saw that the imahes take up 50k. After optimizing the png's I took off 20kb's. Besides that I will never use all the 43 images. Perhaps something to think about. But that's my thought only. ;)</p>",

This version doesn't seem to \"refresh\" the map. I only see the first marker. Adding mymap.refresh doesn't work either. When I zoom the map The markers are visible instantly. What do I need to do to see it \"live\"? In version 1.6 this worked perfect (without mymap.refresh).</p>",
