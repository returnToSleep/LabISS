Furtheremore if i reopen the control - i get 10 TileLoader threads. If i close it and open again - its 15. Obvious memory leak. \r<br />\nSo i was wondering if there is a method which disposes of GMapControl correctly terminating associated threads. I cant seem to find any. \r<br />\nCheers.<br />\n",
