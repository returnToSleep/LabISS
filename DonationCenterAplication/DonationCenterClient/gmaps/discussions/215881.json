Now I am creating a mapping program to assist with routing and want to show the territories on this map (similar to MapPoint). What is easiest way or are there any built in functions for creating a &quot;shaded&quot; or colored area around a zip code or group of zip codes? I searched the discussions and found very little.</p>",
