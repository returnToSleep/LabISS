    "Html": "I am seeing this problem with Windows Forms runtime version 2.0.50727 when I select an area (Alt-Right Click) and then left click anywhere.  If I right click to clear the selected area, the problem goes away.  I tried to handle this in the Mouse Up handler by checking to see if SelectedArea was not empty, and if so drawing my own polygon in place of the selected area and setting map.SelectedArea = RectLatLng.Empty.  This did not solve the issue.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.\r<br />\n<br />\nSteve Kirchner<br />\n",
