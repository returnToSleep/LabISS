I know that getting the tiles and saving them is done async. But in the demo sources I can't see how to\r\n know, that saving for all tiles is done. So if I use the export possibility directly after the prefetch, i can still see that there are I/O Operations in the tile cache, so i think there are not all tiles in my exported gmdb-file.</p>\r\n<p>Does anybody have an idea how to i can check if all tiles are saved before i call the export function ?</p>\r\n<p>Many thanks and greets</p>\r\n<p>Hans</p>\r\n",

Does this mean, everything should already be fine if I'am using the TilePrefetcher form just like in the demos application ? I am now using the newest version of you great Framework and things seems to be better\r\n now. I just want to be sure not do forget something and to have all wished tiles in my gmdb-File.</p>\r\n",
