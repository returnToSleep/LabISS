I am just a novice programmer. I have to say that this GMap control is awesome, but maybe a bit too overwhelmed for me coz it is so complex and the codes, documentations, tutorials are scattered all over the place\r\n and I often confuse where to start (as a beginner) so therefore I kindly ask anyone here to share their expertise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI want to use my program on a computer that does not have access to internet at all (even for initial cache or prefetch), and also does not have access to the application data (so in my code i changed the local cache to @&quot;C:\\GMapCache\\&quot;; as suggested in this\r\n forum).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I use a different PC that has internet to initially prefetched the maps - using the demo program, then exported it to .gmdb. and hope that I can use this file in my program to get the map offline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn my program I defined the access mode to CacheOnly, and do this: put the gmdb in C:\\GMapCache\\TileDBv5\\en folder, and the map does not load (blue tiles).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then deleted the cache files from C:\\GMapCache\\TileDBv5\\en&nbsp; and added an import button. I imported the gmdb file, and i seen it sitting in the C:\\GMapCache\\TileDBv5\\en folder. But again the map still does not load (blue screen).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI honestly have no idea as to why. Can anyone who has successfully access the map using CacheOnly enlighten and maybe share their piece of code?</p>\r\n",
