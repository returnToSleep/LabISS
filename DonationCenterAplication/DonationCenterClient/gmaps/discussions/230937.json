Is&nbsp;GetRouteBetweenPoints using google maps API? If yes, I think there is a problem with limit requests.</p>\r\n<p>2. Did you experienced this problem?</p>\r\n<p>3. How can understand this problem (on my code) if google cut the connection?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It never happened to me, but it can be possible to happen.</p>",
