Do I need to somehow make a list of points for my semi-circle? I would like to end up with a region\r\n that is a 1/3 of a circle (a 120 degree slice). If someone could point me in the right direction or give me some resources to help with understanding the drawing aspect of the software, that would be greatly appreciated.</p>\r\n",
