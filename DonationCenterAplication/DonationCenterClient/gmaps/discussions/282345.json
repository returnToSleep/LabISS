I get the following error:</p>\r\n<p>Error 1 The type 'System.Windows.Forms.UserControl' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'System.Windows.Forms, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089'.</p>\r\n<p>Is there any way around this? I am referencing system.windows.forms but i think its v3.5. I assumed that they would be backwards compatible? I am a bit of a noob with the compact framework.</p>\r\n",
