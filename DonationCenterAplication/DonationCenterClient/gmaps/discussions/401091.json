When I have no internet, it only shows blue screen. The message shown is &quot;Exception: The remote name couldn't be resolved mt1.google.com. We are sorry but we don't\r\n have imagery at this zoom level for this region.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>How can I store the gmdb file to the cache even though I have no internet connection?</p>\r\n<p>Please give me guidelines or sample procedures.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Jeff Jaret</p>\r\n",
