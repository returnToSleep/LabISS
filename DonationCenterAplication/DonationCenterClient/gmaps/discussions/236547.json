When zooming in or out to zoom levels which where not loaded before, it works, but returning to an previously loaded zoom leven shows the \"old\" MapProviders which are not in the overlay property anymore. Sending an \"ReloadMap\" does not help! Also \"Manager.Mode\" is set to \"ServerOnly\" already. The only way to get it behave in the intended way seems to set \"Manager.UseMemoryCache\" to \"False\"...<br /><br />Is there an error with the memory cache while working with changing multiple MapProvider overlays or am I doing something wrong?</p>\r\n<p>Thank you for your help!</p>",
