In old version, i could draw a lot of polygons without performance lost, but actually i draw just 3 polygons and the control is responsible any more. Is it possible that the events Click, Over and so are the problem, 'cause this is new? Perhaps you can build 2 Types of Polygons(with/without events)?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for your help</p>\r\n<p>bye EDE</p>",
