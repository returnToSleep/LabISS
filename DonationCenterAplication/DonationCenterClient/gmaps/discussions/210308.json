    "Html": "<p>yeah, I understand that point :) but since i'm using a usb data edge card, I loose the connection to internet some time.. and right now the problem I have is I have empty tile after some time... and the reason is when I don't have the internet connection the application hang.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So I have 5 connection trying to &quot;download&quot; new map because I don't have them, fine. But if I come back when I have the map in cache, it will not load them, because the application we'll wait for the 5 connection finish first... so it take 1-2 min for the timeout, and I don't have any map on screen even if I have those. (maybe it will be a great idea to check if I have the title into memory map?)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>and after some time, even if I have the internet connection back, it &quot;loading&quot; for ever. I need to stop the &quot;demo&quot; and play it again for make it work again.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>maybe a solution will be, if we have 5 and more &quot;waiting&quot; connection, maybe make another connection, but only for checking cache?</p>\r\n<p>Sorry for bad english, i'm french :)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
