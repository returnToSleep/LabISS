Especially&nbsp;rotate functionality is awesome.</p>\r\n<p>I have&nbsp;a problem with ArcGis map's&nbsp;projection. I would like to have ArcGis map which is viewed from straight above like this:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=7990d7ea55204450b8110d57e20c99ab\">http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=7990d7ea55204450b8110d57e20c99ab</a></p>\r\n<p>So I want to get rid of that 3D look, which that current PlateCarreeProjection have.&nbsp;I have tried&nbsp;MercatorProjection which corrects the 3D problem but then the map&nbsp;is too small to view whole world.&nbsp;Could please help me? I am using Windows Forms version.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
