I am writing c# application which get nmea data from gps receiver, parse that and display points on the gmap - in real time as markers, point after point. But performance is not good. When I get about 300 points, application is\r\n slowly and slowly, in the end it's freeze. I am getting data from RichTextBox with event when it's change. When I have a lot of points, RichTextBox is slowly too.. Display a point is realised by:</p>\r\n<pre>overlayOne.Markers.Add...,\ngMapControl1.Overlays.Add(overlayOne);\ngMapControl1.ZoomAndCenterMarkers(<span>&quot;OverlayOne&quot;</span>);\ngMapControl1.Refresh();</pre>\r\n<p>And it's in every event.. It refresh whole map everytime when I add new marker..</p>\r\n<p>Can someone write me a universal code, which is quicker?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks.</p>\r\n",
