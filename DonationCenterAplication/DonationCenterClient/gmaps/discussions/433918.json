In my environment it's not good - application setup should be as simple as possible. And only one mode - CacheOnly should be enabled, because there is no internet connection in my environment - so there is no any reason to write something to shared cache from different clients. </li>\n<li>If sql setup is absolutely required, is it possible to import saved cache from Data.gmdb to sql instance?</li>\n</ol>\n",
