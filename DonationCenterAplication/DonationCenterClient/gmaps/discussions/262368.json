Maybe someone had the same problem too or someone knows why this problem occures.</p>\r\n<p>I call a WinForm from an other Form where the GMap Control is located in (ShowDialog()). So far so good, but when I try to close the dialog the Form with the GMap control closes and the mainform blockades for about eight seconds.</p>\r\n<p>I tried to do a lot of debugging, but I couldn't find the reason for the time the mainform blockades. It just blockades if i load a map, if I do not load a map and close the form it works fine.</p>\r\n<p>Can anybody please tell me what's the problem in that case?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks and best regards.</p>\r\n",
