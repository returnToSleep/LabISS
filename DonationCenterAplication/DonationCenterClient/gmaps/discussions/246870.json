However, I would need to use only locally stored maptiles for this one project that has to work even without an internet connection. I looked around a bit in the code and so far I've\r\n changed the MakeImageUrl -method (to generate URI pointing at a the local files instead). Then, however, I checked from where this was called and realized it wasn't quite that simple.</p>\r\n<p>So basically, what should I do in order to use my locally stored files (under &lt;the folder that contains the binary&gt;/&lt;zoomLevel&gt;/&lt;X&gt;/&lt;Y&gt;.png)? I only have the files for zoom levels 0-5 anyways, and that's all I need. Now I just need\r\n to figure out how to use them :)</p>\r\n",
