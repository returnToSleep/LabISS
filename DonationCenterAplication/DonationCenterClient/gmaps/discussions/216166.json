As you know once you get to a certain zoom level say in Google Maps then there are no tiles available at that level. Is it possible to have the tiles that were available at the highest zoom level be stretched to effectivly zoom in on available tiles.For example this may mean that only one tile (or only part of it is shown)but it still fills the entire screen. Much like the way Google Earth does it. Thanks</p>",
