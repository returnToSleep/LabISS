Let me explain.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>My application runs in both a 32bit and 64bit environments, and its a pain to add and readd the 32 bit and 64 bit SQL Lite references to get the thing to work correctly. Currently I have both projects set to compile as Any CPU and the GMap.Core is referencing the 32bit SQLlite DLL. Everything works fine in the 32bit environment however in the 64 bit one I am getting blue map tiles saying it cant pull data down from the server. So my question is how do i disable caching just to force it to pull directly each time so that i dont get the blue map tiles in the 64 bit environment.</p>",
