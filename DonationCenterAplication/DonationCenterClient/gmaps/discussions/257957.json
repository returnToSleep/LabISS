It consistently says &quot;Skipped &lt;operation&gt;&quot; whether the &lt;operation&gt; is Build, Rebuild or Clean; I tried this for individual projects and for the solution.</p>\r\n<p>I took the following steps before build:</p>\r\n<p>1. Checked out the latest source using the https link to the mercurial repo. (It's timestamped May 4, 2011).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>2. Hit &quot;Cancel&quot; on the password request for strong name key store.</p>\r\n<p>3. Set active solution platform to x86&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>4. Removed the &quot;GMap.NET - Hot Build&quot; project (based on the discussion - <a href=\"http://greatmaps.codeplex.com/discussions/237244\">\r\nhttp://greatmaps.codeplex.com/discussions/237244</a>)</p>\r\n<p>5. Ensured that the *.WindowsMobile projects were not built on x86 platform.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Please let me know how to resolve this issue. Thanks!</p>\r\n",
