I know you are a smart guy and sometimes you feel like questions from beginners like myself should be ignored.  However, I think if you could help guide beginners like me learning how to use your tool better, your tool would have a greater positive impact in the world :) (even though the effects might be small).  Anyhow, your tool allows me to explore the mapping capability faster and a lot better than if I would do this from scratch, so thank you very much for that.  I have a few questions and if you could in your spare time answer them if you would:\r<br />\n<br />\n1) Is it possible to use GMAP to rotate the map in the direction that we travel?<br />\n\r<br />\n2) How is that information store (in GDirections)?\r<br />\n<br />\nTake as long as you want.  I am trying to learn as much as I can. :) Thank you.<br />\n",
