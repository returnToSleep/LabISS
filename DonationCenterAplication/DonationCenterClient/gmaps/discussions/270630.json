The problem is, with the new caching system the downloaded tiles are still in the cache queue, when the download is long finished, so when the user closes the program, the tiles in the queue  are not stored in the database.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to somehow alert the user when the queue is empty and all tiles are stored in the database (raise an event?). Then I could just show a wait dialog, until all tiles are saved.</p>\n<p>Please help!</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot</p>",
