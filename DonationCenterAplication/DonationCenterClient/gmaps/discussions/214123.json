It works fine when you scroll the mouse wheel over some map that has loaded, however scrolling with the mouse pointer over a map tile (i.e. the map image square that loads when you get some new maps downloaded) that hasn't loaded yet doesn't zoom the map. i.e. it seems the scroll event only works when the mouse is over a loaded point in the map.\r\n\r\nAm I doing something wrong?\r\n\r\nKeith",
