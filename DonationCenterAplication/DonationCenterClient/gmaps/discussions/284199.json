After the first move it doesn't  change anymore, only on the very first one.<br /> <br /> I'm using: &nbsp;<span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span><span style=\"background-color: white;\">.MainMap.MouseWheelZoomType = GMap.NET.MouseWheelZoomType.ViewCenter;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Question:<br /> Being my second time in C# i'm a bit of a noob, if i want to change, or create some new functions how is the procedure? Do i have to decompile-&gt;  change - &gt;compile GMap.Net.Core.dll?</span></p>\n<p><span>Many thanks...&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: white;\"><br /> </span></p>",
