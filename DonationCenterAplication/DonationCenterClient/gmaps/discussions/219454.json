Is there anyway to redraw the overlay, or something to that effect?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;EDIT: I was browsing the forum, and the following looked promissing, however it didn't change anything&nbsp;(as far as I could tell):</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:x-small\">\r\n<p>gMapControl1.UpdatePolygonLocalPosition(selectedPoly);</p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Steven</p>",
