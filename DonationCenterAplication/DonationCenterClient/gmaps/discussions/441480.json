If I use the mouse wheel to zoom in/out the map many times, after I close the application, it got left in task manager, maybe 2 minutes, maybe 10 minutes, sometimes forever. I more I zoom the map, the longer it stuck in task manager. If I do not zoom the map at all, it disappears from task manager straightway after I close it.\r<br />\n<br />\nI tried on XP + SP3, Win7 and the application was compiled both with .Net 2.0, 3.5 framework, and makes no difference.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance for your help.\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards\r<br />\n<br />\nWei Guo<br />\n",
