See Exception.InnerException for details.&nbsp; The error is: Could not load file or assembly 'GMap.NET.WindowsForms, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b85b9027b614afef' or one of its dependencies.

Right now the first call to Gmap.net.windowsforms is wrapped in a try/catch and still the exception is thrown...<br>I can give the source if you want to have a look.</p>",
