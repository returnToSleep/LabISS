Since I not only display the map but lots of other data aswell that makes the whole app &quot;stumble&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>Is there a way to generate the MAP-image without adding the control to the GUI (then I could put the map-generation in a seperate thread)?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Regards</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Carsten</p>\r\n",
