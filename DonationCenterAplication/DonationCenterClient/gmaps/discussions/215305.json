I didn't execute many queries.</p>\r\n<p>Ofcourse the place where i did execute is big and we all share same ip address. it could be that someone else did a large geocode...</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>apparently this limitation is applicable per ip-address if you use the http request method. using the API, it would be a &quot;user&quot; limitation rather than a ip-address limitation.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now the question:</p>\r\n<p>in GMaps, what method is implemented?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Br,</p>\r\n<p>Guy</p>\r\n<p>&lt;From Google:&nbsp;By using client side geocoding you ensure that these limits apply to each user individually, rather than to the combined request volume generated by all of your users. It also ensures that the requests are made directly to<strong>Google</strong>, which will improve the performance of your application.&gt;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
