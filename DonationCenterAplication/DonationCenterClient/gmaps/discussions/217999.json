    "Html": "<p>Thanks for your very very very fast reply.</p>\r\n<p>you are correct. I can remove the route. But as per my functionality if i come back to the New york again my route must be visible. Consider the following scenario and we can check this even with the demo application</p>\r\n<p>1. Draw a route between points near New York.</p>\r\n<p>2. Navigate to for ex Paris using geocode where you can see the route will be shown. ( I want to clear here)</p>\r\n<p>3. Navigate to some other places. (It must not show here)</p>\r\n<p>4. After 'n' places i am giving New York or some area near my route. Route must be visible.</p>\r\n<p>have i missed anything in concept of GMap.NET</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Balaji</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
