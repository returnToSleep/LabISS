When add a GMap control to my windows for everything goes smoothly, but when I run/debug the application the control suddenly goes beyond the size I have set for it and fill the complete windows form. I must clearly be doing something\r\n wrong but what ? It's seems that if I set MaximumSize to the same as Size the control get's it's real size back, but it's at the location I've specified in the control, but at 0,0 !?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I'm using the latest build of GMap.</p>\r\n<p>Any hints...</p>\r\n",
