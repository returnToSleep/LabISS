    "Html": "<p>Hi. If I&nbsp;set GMap to use&nbsp;GoogleSatellite maps, and I zoom to my location - 11 Sunrise Avenue, Maroelana, Pretoria, South Africa (Long = 28.26,&nbsp;Lat = -25.7777), the tiles at the highest 4 zoom levels do not load. I instead get a blue tile with this following error message:</p>\r\n<p>Exception: The remote server returned an error: (404) Not Found.<br>We are sorry, but we don't have imagery at this zoom level for this region.</p>\r\n<p>The funny thing is if I go to Google Maps, and switch to Satellite view, those tiles are in fact there. Do you know why this might be? Why the Satellite maps exist on the Google Maps&nbsp;website but they apparently do not exist on GMap.NET?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for an amazing product!!</p>",
