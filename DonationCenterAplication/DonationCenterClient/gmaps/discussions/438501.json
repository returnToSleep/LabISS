I want to simulate vehicle running as markers on the map.\r<br />\nI can do it if the new lat/lng position is given by setting new position of markers as you did in flight tracking or vehicle tracking. However, when I'm simulating vehicles, I don't have new lat/lng positions. I have only current position, distance to go and bearing.\r<br />\n<br />\nCould you please suggest me how to set new lat/lng position from current position, distance to go and bearing?\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you very much.<br />\n",
