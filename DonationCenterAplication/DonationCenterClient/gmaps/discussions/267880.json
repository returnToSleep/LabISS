I've can't find either of those files in your fork. I've tried to point it to the standard version but on compiling it says that the Interfaces is missing (I presume as the version of the 2 DLLs I'm using dosen't have the code you added - any suggestions?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n<p>Charlotte.</p>",
