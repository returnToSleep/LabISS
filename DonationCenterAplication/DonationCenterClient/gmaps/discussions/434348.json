The GMap control is in tab #3.\r<br />\n<br />\nUsing debug output, I know that the routine that sets-up the map control is running, but the map does not actually display until the tab for its page is selected. This presents the user with a blank area for a couple seconds before the map is actually seen.\r<br />\n<br />\nI have been trying different ways to force the map to paint without having to select the tab, but with no luck.\r<br />\n<br />\nSo I would like to know if I can force GMap to paint the map &quot;in the blind&quot; or is this just how things work in Tab Controls?\r<br />\n<br />\nChuck<br />\n",
