And now, i think it should be useful to have another property.</p>\r\n<p>It would be helpful to have a property to change the mouse button for area selection, similar to the GMapControl.DragButton. &nbsp;This is useful to allow the drag function with left button (as maps.google.com), and zoom to area using the right button (GMapControl.SelectionButton\r\n for instance).</p>\r\n<p>Best regards.</p>\r\n<p>Sergio</p>\r\n",
