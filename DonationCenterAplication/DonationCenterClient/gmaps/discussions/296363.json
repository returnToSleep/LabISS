The second form is designed to be a popup window. The problem I have is that when I close the\r\n second form and then try to interact with the map on the first form, the map on the first form disappears and is replaced with a big red cross. It seeems as if the map on form1 is deleted when I close form2. Can you please suggest why this is happening? Both\r\n forms have their own instance of the GMapControl so I am confused by what is causing this.</p>\r\n<p>Cheers, Julian.</p>\r\n",
