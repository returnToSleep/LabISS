Using this I want to Plot a Track, Pin head etc.. I am using Windows XP and my client application is a Windows Standalone application\r\n (without internet connection).</p>\r\n<p>Can GMap.net be used to utilize .osm files (without internet connection). Are there any Software Development Kits like GMap.net for offline map data from Open Street Map.</p>\r\n<p>Please advice.</p>\r\n",
