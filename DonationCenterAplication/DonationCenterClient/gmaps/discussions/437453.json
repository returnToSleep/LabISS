However, I require one for WPF.\r<br />\n<br />\nI have to find the necessary classes in the WPF library but found that the follwing classes and methods are missing from the library:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>GMapOverlay mapControl (in MainForm.cs)</li>\n<li>mapControl.Overlays (in MainForm.cs)</li>\n<li>\nprotected override void OnPaintOverlays(System.Drawing.Graphics g) (in MapControl.cs)<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nIs there any way to add the cloud overlay in the WPF even without these classes/methods?<br />\n",
