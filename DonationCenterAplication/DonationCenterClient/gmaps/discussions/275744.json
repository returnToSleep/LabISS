The &quot;custom marker&quot; has an icon as it's only UIElement and I've overridden the Onrender method which works great initially (by using icon.LayoutTransform\r\n = new RotateTransform(..)), rotating the icon. However I'd like to be able to do something like:</p>\r\n<p>(customMarker.Shape as OwnUnit).SetHeading = 123</p>\r\n<p>where SetHeading sets a private member containing the rotation of the icon, but the OnRender seems to be called only the first rendering of the shape - not when changing the position for a given marker having the UserControl as shape. Do you know how I can\r\n accomplish this?</p>\r\n<p>Many thanks in advance<br>\r\n/Peter</p>\r\n",
