I had to customize it a little, but it was really easy and the result is awesome.</p>\r\n<p>I also have a question and this might be helpful to many: is there a way to enable a Google Map like navigation (those buttons that allows you move the point on the map on the left, right , up or down, to zoom in/out) - is there in the code? (I didn't see it) or I have to implement on my own?</p>\r\n<p>Thank you again for this great component.</p>\r\n<p>Daniel</p>",

This is really good.</p>\r\n<p>Yes, I think that those navigation buttons are quite good for the end user, so I'm thinking of implementing them. My main problem is that I don't know/understand how and how much to move the map when a user press a up/down/left or right button.</p>\r\n<p>Do you have something for this behavior?</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Daniel</p>",
