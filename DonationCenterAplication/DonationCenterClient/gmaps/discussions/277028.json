Ideally I let the user draw out a polygon then on closing the polygon (end point hitting the start point) the 2 measurements are displayed then the polygon removed?</p>\r\n<p>Forgive my ignorance if this functionality is already present, but if it is I haven't stumbled on it yet.</p>\r\n<p>Many Thanks</p>\r\n<p>Charlotte.</p>\r\n",
