So when the user makes a zoom on the map, and that the software doesn't have any image for this zoom level, many squares appear. And in these squares you are told &quot;Exception : no data in local tile cache&quot;, &quot;we\r\n are sorry..&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>To make this part a bit more sexy, I would like to change the background color, the texts and the fonts. I need to access the text because I have to translate it regarding the culture.</p>\r\n<p>I'm developing under .NET 4 and WPF.</p>\r\n",
