It was a miracle for me when I found it.</p>\r\n<p>This is a general question about the caching functionality.</p>\r\n<p>I've been exploring the discussions but couldn't find a clear answer about how it works: &nbsp;I know that we first need to select an area, click &quot;prefetch&quot;, then click &quot;export&quot; and save the file. After that if we want to load the cache\r\n we click &quot;import&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>I would like to get a deeper explanation about the process.. between the &quot;prefetch&quot; and &quot;export&quot; where is the data kept? what's the purpose of the file that is located in the AppData in TileDBv5? is it just a pure sort of cached map tile\r\n database file which I can use instead of doing the prefetch-export process?</p>\r\n",
