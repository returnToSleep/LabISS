There is no map displayed when using ServerAndCache cachemode. When using cachemode ServerOnly everything is working fine. I am using Windows Forms version in Windows XP enviroment. Reason for why I want to use .NET Framework version 4 is Entity Framework.</p>\r\n<p>I have also tried your Windows Forms&nbsp;demo it does the same thing. So when you compile core and windows forms dll's to .NET framework 4 and build demo also targeted to version 4 only markers and blank map is displayed. When I use&nbsp; the same demo with Framework 3.5 everything is working fine.</p>\r\n<p>Regards, Teemu</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
