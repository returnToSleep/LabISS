    "Html": "<p>I definitely need some tuning.</p>\r\n<p>I used your older control about 2 years ago in my app and was doing the same type of map. That application used about 35 to 55MB of RAM. This current application is going up to 750MB of RAM (ouch).</p>\r\n<p>So, time to tag each marker, reuse it if it is there and drop just the marker from the overlay if it is no longer there. Think of the application as an air traffic map where the traffic drops off when they are out of scope (about 40 miles from the main marker which is on another overlay layer).</p>\r\n<p>I will figure it out to get it using less resources for sure before I release this memory hog LOL (my fault not yours).</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for the help and I will update you on how it is going.</p>",
