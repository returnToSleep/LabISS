There are OSM routing apps in Java and C with APIs you can call into to get GPX and KML routes. Even better would be .Net routing with .OSM data and Djikstras algorithm.</p>\r\n<p>This is available in my fork&nbsp;https://hg01.codeplex.com/forks/viktorbergman/viktorbergman</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I hope you will find it useful :)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

It isn't the easiest data structure to work with, but I've used worse. One minor tricky point. In order to show the route on a GMap instance, you will need to request that you want the routePathOutput (routePathOutput=points) and set your tolerances. This will give you a new collection of points for the MapRoute object.</p>",
