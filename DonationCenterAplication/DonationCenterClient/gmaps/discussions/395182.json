I have tiepoints for the FOV in LatLng, and I am adding them to the GMapMarker.Polygon collection. However the points are not being displayed in the correct position.</p>\r\n<p>To my surprise, I found that when I set the position of the marker itself, e.g. the GMapMarker.Position property, it moves the polygon around on the map.</p>\r\n<p>1. My assumption now is that I have to compute the center of the FOV and find its LatLng location to position the polygon correctly, is this correct?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>2. Why do I enter the tiepoints in LatLng if they are not displayed at the LatLng coords I give it?</p>\r\n<p>3. Is there a better way to do this?</p>\r\n<p>thanks a lot&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
