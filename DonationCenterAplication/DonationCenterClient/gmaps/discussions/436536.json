Below is example what I want to achieve.\r<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/U73DU8w.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" />\r<br />\n<br />\nDo I have to create my own class from <strong>GMapMarker</strong> and then create do the rotation of marker object myself in rendering routines based on some rotation variable, which will represent bearing? Is there a better/more natural way to achieve this?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks a lot.<br />\n",
