When I use ZoomAndCenterRoute() the zoom factor is much too big. The route is in the middle 10% of the picture. I would expect something like a bit of overzoom around the bounding boxes,  but not so much...</p>\n<p>ZoomAndCenterMarkers has similar behaviour.</p>\n<p>Am i doing something wrong?</p>\n<p>Another thing: when I use MainApp.Offset(10,0); to pan, the map is moving correctly, but the route.Markers and route.Routes stay where they are. When zooming they jump in place. So my current hack is</p>\n<p>&nbsp;MainMap.SuspendLayout();<br />MainMap.Zoom = MainMap.Zoom*1.1;<br />MainMap.Zoom = MainMap.Zoom/1.1;<br />MainMap.ResumeLayout();</p>\n<p>But htat stinks...</p>\n<p>Do you have a suggestion?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here my code snippet.

But then I got troubles with System.Data.SQLite.DLL</p>\n<p>I added a link the x86 and x64 files to my project (no build action, Copy always) and they are correctly placed in (x86/x64) sub folders of the exe folder.</p>\n<p>BUT: after build also a copy of System.Data.SQLite.DLL aapears in the same dir as the exe, most probably because GMap.NEt.Core references it still.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;When starting it then gives a reference error. When I copy the accompanying xml file as well in the exe folder, it works again.</p>\n<p>When I remove System.Data.SQLite.DLL from the exe folder by hand, after buiding, all is working fine too. Than it references the x86 folder System.Data.SQLite.DLL and XML</p>\n<p>So as a workaround I leave a copy of the XML in the exe folder for now</p>\n<p>I could solve it as well by not linking your source code but only your dll's but during development that is less convenient.</p>\n<p>Any clue?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>BTW: the offset issue still exists. Or do i have to refresh/invalidate them in a way?</p>",
