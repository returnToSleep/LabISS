    "Html": "<p>I think this is probably possible, but you would to do a bit of coding to make it work... I think what you would need to do would be to treat the hole as a separate polygon. Then you would need to have something within the tag of both the outer polygon and inner polygon to tell each that they are related so that when either is clicked on they behave properly. Then if you are storing these in a database, you would need an attribute such as Parent ID so you could chain them together. If you take this to it's logical conclusion, if you are putting a hole in the polygon then in theory, you then might want to create an island within the hole which is part of the outer polygon and so on. Storing the Parent ID's within the Tags would probably be the way to go with this...</p>",
