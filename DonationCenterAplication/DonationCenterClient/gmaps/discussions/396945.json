But the markers overlapp sometimes and on this area i can't see the map.</p>\r\n<p>Does anyone has a solution?</p>\r\n<p>1. check if markers cut each other and create one complex marker is very difficult.</p>\r\n<p>2. add a maximum alpha value to this layer, could be help but i have no idea how to implement.</p>\r\n<p>thank for some tips</p>\r\n<p>bye EDE</p>\r\n",
