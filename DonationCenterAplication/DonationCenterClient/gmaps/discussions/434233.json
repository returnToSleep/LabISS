I have been using it for a couple of months and have had wonderful success with the WPF version of this control.\r<br />\n<br />\nI am having an issue with showing a bitmap on a layer in the Windows Forms version. When zoomed out, the bitmap shows in Alaska, but the more I zoom in the more the bitmap goes to its correct location around the lower portion of California.\r<br />\n<br />\nI have checked and I am sending it the correct coordinates, and code that is very similar is working in the WPF version of this control.\r<br />\n<br />\nAny help is greatly appreciated.<br />\n",
