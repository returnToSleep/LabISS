So, If zoom level set to larger than 15, tile downloads will be failed.</p>\r\n<p>To avoid this issue, I'd use this code <em>GoogleKoreaHybridMapProvier.MaxZoom = 15</em>. But this code drops quality of background satellite images via over-zooming. Without this, 16 and 17 levels had no hybrid overlays such as roads, POI labels.</p>\r\n<p>Is there any ways to solve this issue? Sorry, I had no idea :(</p>\r\n<p>Thank you for your great works, again.</p>\r\n",
