But how can I detect if I can connect or not to the server (and then I will now if the &quot;null&quot; that returns is from a CONNECTION ERROR and not because of the invalid position)?</p>\r\n<p>When&nbsp;I have&nbsp;only a few positions and there is a problem with connection it&acute;s ok, but when I have more positions to convert, then my app will freeze until it gets a timeot for EVERY position.</p>\r\n<p>I can check for the &quot;null&quot; and skip the verification of the other positions, but what if the &quot;null&quot; is from a invalid position instead of a timeout?</p>\r\n<p>Thank you!</p>\r\n<p>P.S.: Congratulations for your excelent work!!!</p>\r\n<p>Rudolf Gutlich</p>",

It will help if it includes the information also splitted in many properties, like in the XML in this link: <a href=\"http://code.google.com/intl/pt-BR/apis/maps/documentation/geocoding/index.html\">http://code.google.com/intl/pt-BR/apis/maps/documentation/geocoding/index.html</a></p>\r\n<p>Thank you,</p>\r\n<p>Rudolf Gutlich</p>",
