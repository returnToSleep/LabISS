( DrawRoutes(Graphics g))\r\n\r\nTo do so I've created a inheritated class of GMapOverlay.\r\nBut since my class is not part of the GMap.net assembly, I can't get the LocalPoints since they are internal.\r\n\r\nI'd rather not alter the assembly, since I want to keep up with changes.\r\n\r\nIs there a simple way to get to do what I want, without modifying the GMap.net assembly ?\r\n\r\nThanks",
