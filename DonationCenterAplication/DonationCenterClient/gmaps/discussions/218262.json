Am I correct in thinking that I can't remove a marker from this delegate? I don't believe I can get to the GMapoverlay from the GMapMarker because it's internal. Is there an easy way I can determine which overlay I am on, and which set of items (polygons, markers etc) I need to remove the item from?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>",
