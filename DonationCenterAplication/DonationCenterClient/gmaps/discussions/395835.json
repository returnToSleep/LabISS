Is it possible to draw a minimum bounding rectangle (bounding box) around an area on a map? &nbsp;It looks like you can create polygons but I need a way to fix the shape as a sizable rectangle (just like in MS Paint if you select the rectangle from the\r\n shape tool).</p>\r\n<p>2. Assuming that #1 is doable, is it also possible to retrieve lat/long coordinates for the upper-left and lower-right corners of that rectangle? &nbsp;And if so, is that functionality dependent on any particular map provider(s) or do they all include the\r\n geospatial metadata in their tilesets?</p>\r\n<p>Thank you very much for reading as well as any information you can provide!</p>\r\n",
