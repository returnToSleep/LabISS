The control is on a Windows Form and it load the map add a route and a marker, all work fine.</p>\r\n<p>Now i try to do the same thing but with a control created by code and without be visible, i mean, i need to make a lot of images of a lot of points, so i make all on code, but then i use the &quot;.ToImage()&quot; method, it save the image of the current state of the application, i mean it show the &quot;form&quot; and not the map.</p>\r\n<p>The question is, do i need to put visible the user control to save the image?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for all, and take care.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iv&aacute;n.</p>",
