I have found the default location and name of the cache file : &quot;data.gmdb&quot;\r<br />\n<br />\nIt has two tables quite easy to understand :<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Tiles : id/x/y/zoom/type/cachetime</li>\n<li>\nTilesData : id/tile<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nMy concern is about the &quot;type&quot; field ..... it is an unsigned integer field. I would like to know the conversion table between the map providers and &quot;type&quot; field -&gt; where can I find that information ?\r<br />\n<br />\nWhat I would to do is to create my own cache files, with my own tiles, and display them using gmaps.\r<br />\n<br />\nI have detected that : &quot;OpenStreetMaps&quot; = 1497893838, but for example : ??? = 1492776782 (that was already in the cache .... )\r<br />\n<br />\nPlus, how can I tell to gmaps to use specific cache files with names different frome &quot;data.gmbd&quot; ?<br />\n",
