When move dockpanel to different possition (from left to top), GMapControl crashes at Core.cs #line 930, <em>while(waitForTileLoad.WaitOne(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5)))</em> with save handle closed.</p>\r\n<p>Same error can be reproduced when <a title=\"Odyssey Outlook Bar\" href=\"http://odyssey.codeplex.com/\">Odyssey Outlook Bar</a> is used. With this docking GMapControl crashes immediately after start with same reason on same line.</p>\r\n<p>Any idea? I would be very happy for any hint. Anyway I would like to thank you for this great control!</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Bop</p>",
