    "Html": "Hi, \r<br />\nThis is a very cool app, kudos for the team that worked on this. I found the app very useful.\r<br />\nI am trying to cache an entire city or state to the street level zoom. \r<br />\nFor example I tried to cache the entire city of Palm Springs, CA. \r<br />\nI selected the desired the area by clicking Alt + dragging the mouse. Then I zoomed to the street level and waited for all the tiles to be cached. There were like 450+ tiles.\r<br />\nAfter this I disabled the internet and opened in cache only mode, I can see the city fine at zoom 14-15 level, but as I zoom in the streets appear blur. Happened the same when I tried to cache the entire state of Nevada.\r<br />\nI also tried to export and import the city and state caches with the same result!!\r<br />\nAppreciate any help.\r<br />\nThanks in advance\r<br />\nSteve<br />\n",
