THank you a million times!\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the harder stuff ;0) \r\nI have written a small Application on WinMobile that works fine when Internet is connected, yet when i want to switch to cache only i only get blank tiles (or rather blue ones with an exception overlaying the message that no tile could be loaded). Is there maye a step by step example on how to load caches on mobile? It seems as if Desktop has ShowImportDialog() as method which the Mobile lacks and hence i have to rely on CacheLocation and so on - which obviously does not work..\r\n\r\nMight be someone friendly enough to help me?
