When the user selects different item from the combomox I am clearing all the existing markers and adding just one marker based on the selection. I would like the zoom to stay at level 19. \r<br />\nBut when the statement ZoomAndCenterMarkers executes the zoom is going back to 10, no matter what I do!!\r<br />\nI guess my question how do I zoom to a single marker with zoom 19.\r<br />\nThanks in advance.\r<br />\nSteve<br />\n",
